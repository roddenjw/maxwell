## Phase 10: Desktop Distribution & Packaging
**Timeline:** February 2026
**Status:** 🚧 In Progress
**Goal:** Ship Maxwell as a true desktop application for privacy-conscious writers

### Background

Maxwell was designed as a **local-first fiction writing IDE** with privacy as a core principle. The architecture supports this vision (SQLite, local Git, BYOK AI), but distribution has been web-only. Phase 10 addresses this gap.

### Deployment Phases

#### Phase D1: Self-Hosted Beta (Week 1) - IN PROGRESS
**Target:** Privacy-conscious early adopters who can run Docker

**Deliverables:**
- ✅ Docker Compose configuration (`docker-compose.yml`)
- ✅ Backend Dockerfile with multi-stage build
- ✅ Frontend Dockerfile with nginx proxy
- ✅ Installation scripts (Unix + Windows)
- ✅ Desktop deployment documentation

**Usage:**
```bash
# One-command installation
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/your-repo/maxwell/main/scripts/install.sh | bash

# Or manual
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/maxwell.git
cd maxwell && docker-compose up -d
# Open http://localhost:3000
```

#### Phase D2: Electron Desktop App (Weeks 2-4)
**Target:** General users who want a native experience

**Deliverables:**
- [ ] Electron main process with window management
- [ ] Backend manager (PyInstaller bundle)
- [ ] Auto-start/stop backend with app lifecycle
- [ ] Native file dialogs for manuscript export
- [ ] System tray integration
- [ ] Platform-specific installers (DMG, NSIS, AppImage)

**Technical Approach:**
- Electron for cross-platform desktop shell
- PyInstaller to bundle Python backend as single executable
- IPC for frontend-backend communication (fallback to HTTP)
- electron-builder for packaging all platforms

#### Phase D3: Distribution Infrastructure (Weeks 5-6)
**Target:** Sustainable distribution and updates

**Deliverables:**
- [ ] GitHub Releases workflow for automated builds
- [ ] Auto-update mechanism (electron-updater)
- [ ] macOS code signing + notarization
- [ ] Windows code signing (EV certificate)
- [ ] Crash reporting (opt-in, privacy-respecting)
- [ ] Download page on website

### Architecture Decisions

**ADR-D01: Electron over Tauri**
- Electron chosen for faster time-to-market (3-4 weeks vs 5-6)
- Team familiar with JavaScript/TypeScript
- Mature ecosystem (electron-builder, auto-updater)
- Bundle size (~150MB) acceptable for desktop

**ADR-D02: PyInstaller for Backend**
- Bundles Python + dependencies + spaCy models
- One-file mode for simple distribution
- Works on Windows, macOS, Linux
- Well-documented for FastAPI applications

**ADR-D03: Docker for Self-Hosted**

## Phase 11: Quality & Polish
**Timeline:** February-March 2026
**Status:** 🚧 In Progress
**Goal:** Improve code quality, fix known issues, and polish the user experience

### 11.1 Fix Agent Tool Execution ✅
**Status:** Complete (Feb 20, 2026)

Agents previously had stub `_run_with_tools()` that only appended tool descriptions as text. Now uses real LangChain `model.bind_tools()` + tool-call loop so agents can dynamically invoke tools.

**Changes:**
- `LLMService`: Exposed `get_langchain_model()` and `convert_messages()` public methods
- `AgentConfig`: Added `max_tool_iterations` field (default 3)
- `BaseMaxwellAgent._run_with_tools()`: Full rewrite with `bind_tools()` + iterative tool execution loop, fallback for unsupported models
- `ConsistencyAgent`: 8 stub context loaders replaced with real DB queries via tool `.invoke()`
- `ResearchAgent`: 2 stub context loaders replaced with real tool invocations
- `SmartCoachAgent`: Real LLM-driven tool calling in `_chat_conversational()`, removed 3 no-op stub methods
- All 180 agent tests updated and passing

### 11.2 Replace `alert()`/`prompt()` with Toast System
**Status:** Planned

35+ components use browser `alert()` and `prompt()` dialogs. Replace with a proper toast/notification system for better UX.

### 11.3 Wire VoiceAnalysis into Navigation
**Status:** Planned

VoiceAnalysis component exists but isn't accessible from the sidebar navigation. Wire it into the activeView system.

### 11.4 Frontend Bundle Splitting
**Status:** Planned

Implement code splitting and route-level lazy loading to reduce initial bundle size.

### 11.5 Test Coverage Improvement
**Status:** Planned

Increase backend test coverage from ~35% to 60%+. Focus on services, routes, and agent integration tests.

- ✅ AI integration for beat suggestions (Phase 3)
- ✅ Lexical editor integration (Phase 1)

### Phase 5 depends on:
- ✅ Entity extraction system (Phase 2)
- ✅ AI integration for idea generation (Phase 3)
- ✅ Story structure templates (Phase 4)

### Phase 6 depends on:
- ✅ Entity tracking (Phase 2)
- ✅ Chapter structure (Phase 1)
- ✅ Plot beats for timeline markers (Phase 4)

### Phase 8 depends on:

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-----------|--------|------------|
| Timeline validation performance slow | Medium | High | Optimize validation algorithms, cache results, background processing |
| AI costs too high for users | Low | High | BYOK model eliminates markup, user controls costs |
| Real-time NLP interrupts writing | Medium | Medium | Debounced extraction, confidence thresholds, user can disable |
| Database size grows too large | Low | Medium | SQLite handles 100GB+, periodic cleanup, export/archive old projects |

### Product Risks
| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-----------|--------|------------|
| Feature complexity overwhelms users | High | High | Progressive disclosure, guided onboarding, tooltips |
| Users don't understand BYOK | Medium | Medium | AI Concierge tutorial, pre-funded $1 credit |
| Story structures feel restrictive | Medium | Medium | Offer freeform mode, custom templates, easy switching |
| Timeline validation false positives | Medium | High | Tunable thresholds, manual override, teaching moments explain why |

### Market Risks
| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-----------|--------|------------|
| Scrivener releases major update | Low | Medium | Focus on AI features Scrivener can't match |
| Sudowrite lowers prices | Medium | Medium | BYOK model is always cheaper (zero markup) |
| Saturation of AI writing tools | High | Low | Maxwell is IDE-first, not AI-first; unique Codex/Timeline |

## Success Criteria: The Full Creation Engine

**When Maxwell becomes indispensable:**
1. ✅ Writers can brainstorm ideas → AI helps generate options
2. ✅ Writers can outline → AI suggests plot beats based on proven structures
3. ✅ Writers can draft → Real-time structure guidance shows current beat
4. ✅ Writers can revise → Consistency checking across entire manuscript (Codex + Timeline)
5. ✅ Writers can finish → Export to DOCX/PDF, share with beta readers, publish

**Competitive Moat:**
- **Scrivener** lacks AI and Codex intelligence
- **Sudowrite** lacks structure and organization features
- **Plottr** lacks full writing environment and AI
- **Maxwell** combines all three: IDE + Intelligence + Structure

**Vision Metrics:**
- Time from idea → first draft: **30% faster** than industry average
- Manuscript completion rate: **3x industry average** (~30% vs. 10%)
- User retention: **80%+ after 6 months**
- NPS Score: **70+** (strong likelihood to recommend)
- Viral K-Factor: **0.3+** (sustainable organic growth)
